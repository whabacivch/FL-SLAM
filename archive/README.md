# Archive

This folder contains obsolete files and folders that are no longer used in the current project but are kept for historical reference.

## Contents

### Build Artifacts (Obsolete)
- `build_3d/` - Old 3D-specific build directory (replaced by unified `build/`)
- `install_3d/` - Old 3D-specific install directory (replaced by unified `install/`)
- `log_3d/` - Old 3D-specific log directory (replaced by unified `log/`)

### Code Backups
- `frontend_node_ORIGINAL_BACKUP.py` - Original frontend node implementation before refactoring

## Notes

- Everything is now 3D by default, so the `_3d` suffixes were redundant
- These files are kept for reference but should not be used in development
- To restore any file, copy it from this archive back to the appropriate location
